          <p>For some, fraternity is a house. A structure of walls and rooms where men live and pass time.</p>
          <p>My fraternity has no walls, except perhaps the rock walls of the passes of Mt. Rainier, or the walls of corn in Kansas, the Grand Tetons of Wyoming, the Arch in St. Louis.</p>

          <p>For some men, fraternity is a collection of photos on a wall. </p>
          <p>For my fraternity, it’s the photos taken by the disposable camera kept in my back jersey pocket. It’s the photos taken in front of the welcome signs as we cross state borders. It’s the countless snapshots taken with clients with smiles so wide you can see every tooth, and most of the gums. </p>

          <p>It’s shaving <strong>every day,</strong> remembering to zip up my jersey, remove my sunglasses, tuck in my shirt, and smile for the photos that will hang in homes and offices after I leave this place. </p>

          <p>It’s the stories in the newspapers, and answering the same question, “Tell me what you guys are doing exactly?“ for the hundredth time. </p>

          <p>For some men, fraternity is in the parties on in a cup of beer. </p>

          <p>For my fraternity, it’s the gallons and gallons of water that sustain me. It’s in spotting a support vehicle every ten miles or so, where I can always count on a word of encouragement. It’s in the songs that play over and over on the FM radio stations that become the soundtrack of my summer.</p>

          <p>It’s in the faces of the kids who talk to puppets like they are real people. It’s in preparing meals or shopping in different grocery stores every day so we stay healthy enough to ride tomorrow. It’s in the children asking for autographs, and kind, incredible strangers thanking us for coming, when really, they are the ones who should be thanked. </p>

          <p>It’s in the cry of excitement I hear from the girl in the wheelchair as I ride up for a picnic. </p>

          <p>For some men, fraternity is the pin on the shirt or trophies in a case. </p>

          <p>But my fraternity is in the proclamations in the dozens of small towns celebrating our arrival. It’s in the trucks that move one lane to the left and honk their horns to say hello. It’s in the spaghetti dinner prepared by people I’ve never met, or the grease mark that just won’t scrub off my leg. </p>

          <p>It’s in the gym floors where we sleep and the lump in my throat when a volunteer says, “Goodbye, see you next summer.”</p>

          <p>For some men, fraternity is in the party that ends in the early hours of the morning. </p>

          <p>For my fraternity, it’s the sunrises. It’s in those quiet hours in the flatlands of Wyoming or through the Kansas farmland when the world is asleep, and all you can hear is a dog barking in the distance. </p>

          <p>It’s in the t-shirts that desperately needed a wash two days ago, and is now simply disgusting. </p>

          <p>It’s in maintaining a place in the pace line and moving to the front where the wind is strongest when it’s my turn. It’s in smiling through the second or third flat tire of the day. </p>

          <p>For some men, fraternity is impressing sororities. </p>

          <p>For my fraternity, it’s in the cards and packages that wait for me at the next mail drop, especially the ones with stickers and magic marker hearts all over them. </p>

          <p>It’s the volunteer in Missouri who hugs me like she’s always known me. It’s about getting our butts kicked in wheelchair basketball. </p>

          <p>It’s dancing with the young woman in the wheelchair who makes me blush when she shamelessly hits on me. </p>

            <p>For some men, fraternity is about getting another event t-shirt. </p>

            <p>For my fraternity, it’s forgetting that we’re standing in front of a few thousand people in a baseball stadium, wearing spandex. </p>

            <p>It’s riding next to <a href="http://www.abilityexperience.org/pushcontent.aspx?id=341" target="_blank">Bruce Rogers</a> into Denver, pinching myself because we’re riding with the guy who started it all. </p>

            <p>For some men, fraternity is about pledge class unity, or leadership positions. </p>

            <p>For my fraternity, it’s glancing in my rear view mirrors for the first cyclist to appear as I wait along the roadside. It’s that moment when I realize these guys riding beside me have become my family, and that soon this incredible journey will be a memory. It’s in the relief in the eyes of the staff and crew when we come in safely each day. </p>

            <p>It’s about those times when we get of the bikes and just look out at a piece of scenery so breathtaking that no one says a word. Then, one guy turns away to wipe his eyes with his forearm and says, “Let’s get back on the bikes, fellas.”</p>

            </figure>
            <p>It’s in anticipating the look on my mom’s face as we ride on the grounds of the Capitol, and the pride in my dad’s voice while he waits patiently for mom to let go. </p>

            <p>It’s about arriving at the end and wanting in some small way to turn around and do it again. </p>
